Pipelining and Out of Order Execution
Conclusion 
For sections 2-4 describe/include the following:

What it (i.e. security exploits,  hierarchical memory, pipelining, or out of order Execution) is. 
The motivations of why it is included in architecture
Use at least 4 - 7 associated keywords describe their meaning and relationship with the section and highlight them in bold (e.g. CPI for pipelining, associativity and cache size for memory hierarchy etc)
Provide examples of algorithms or protocols associated with it
Criticize its shortcomings 
Diagrams as examples for clarify
How it can be improved relation to memory and performance
Introduction is a simple overview of the paper. Almost similar to an abstract.

Conclusion reiterate what you described in sections 2 - 4. Criticize the designs and their aims. Discuss areas for future improvements in computer architecture overall.
